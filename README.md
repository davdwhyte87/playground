A sample command-line application with an entrypoint in `bin/`, library code
in `lib/`, and example unit test in `test/`.


I will be learning dart by building a command line program that takes in users data and can query data

- User can get user all student data 
- User can add new student data 
- User can delete data 

Student data structure - a list of maps 
- [
  {Name: "Ade jumo", Age:23, Id: 1}
]
